ideas, interesting things, go-to-later
I am writing this code to kill some time before traffic slows down so I can drive back to mesa. I have a few coding projects in mind, with the main one being our sheena league encyclopedia. i think it would be really cool and would mke some of the guys not give me shit for this. Maybe even make it a big thing and make some money on it. who knows.
